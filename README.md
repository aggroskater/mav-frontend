Initial
=======

Since everybody has to have code on their github --and **recent** code at
that-- this is me writing some code. I've made a habit of compulsively
downloading most of the media I consume. I've been saved by this habit multiple
times, what with videos getting removed, hidden, deleted, etc. It'd be nice to
have a clean front-end that I can browse, my own "Media WayBack Machine" if you
will.

So... in the interest of having something to point at when recruiters and
hiring managers are unconvinced by my years of experience in the field, I now
introduce... `mav-frontend`, the Media Archive Viewer front-end, written in
Angular. I'll likely use
[ngx-videogular](https://github.com/videogular/ngx-videogular) along with OData
client-side libraries to query the backend's OData endpoints.

I don't have any intention of this becoming an actual open source project.
It'll likely just be my own personal archive viewer.
